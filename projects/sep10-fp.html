            <h1 class="margin text-center"> SEP10 Freedom Project (Business)</h1>
            <p>CONTEXT: The Freedom Project was a project where we got to choose a topic we were interested in, and I chose business. We had to look at both the software and hardware parts of our topic to understand how technology is used in it. We also had to pick a software tool from a list and use it in our project. I chose A-Frame and used it to add a cool visual to my website to make it more interesting. Another part of the project was to come up with a creative idea for a new technology that could help our topic in the future. My idea was to turn business conference tables into smart technology that could help during meetings. </p>
            <p>CONTENT: I first started coding my website by planning how and where I wanted the content to be and look like. So, I did that by putting my ideas on a wirefrime. However, on the wireframe I had to create an outline of how my websites would look on mobile and on a computer. For the computer wireframe, I outlined my website to have all the containers lined up next to eachother and on top of eachother. For the navbar, I wanted it have a drop down to the softwares sections, Hardwares section, carousel, and Intro section. I wanted the Intro to be right under the navbar, then the hardwares under the intro, the carousel under the hardwares that would show the type of hardwares business use, then wouuld come the softwares that had the links to websites businesses use to operate, finally the external link to show off the tool I used. I had the same plan outlined for my mobile wirefarme expect I had to rejust some of the content around. For the navbar, I made it where if it was put on a smaller screen like a phone, it would have three lines stacked on eachother, when pressed it would show the options of the conent in the webiste that would take them to that specfic section. for the containers, instead of three of them being lined uo against eachother it woild be 2 next to eachother. Everything else stayed the same. After planning that out, I took all my ideas and coded the final project/website. For coding I used, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. For HTML I used fonts like Ariel, bold, thick letters. Fpr css, I used the color scheme of blue, grey, white, and black. For bootstrap, I used Navbar, carousel, and containers. I started coding in order, navbar, container (Intro), Hardware containers, Carousel, software containers with the links to the webistes in it, then the external link to the design I made using my tool.</p>
            <p>CHALLENGES: I faced many challenges while making my website, most had to do with the code itself. I struggeled with aligning the content, perfecting the navbar on mobile, and coding the A-frame. Making sure that the alignment of the conent in my website was perfect was really hard. There was always something causing it to colapse or not be the way I wanted it to be. For exaample, some containers were closer to eachother than the others. Then there was vertical containers that always collapased. These two problems happened because of a couple of reasons. For when some containers were closer to each other than the others were it was because of the padding, borders, size, etc. So, to fix that to the best way I could, I fixed the padding and szie and made them exactly the same so that they could be the way it should be. For when the containers kept on collapsing, it was because I didn't have the divs stacked or spaced out properly. So when i fixed that issue, the containers became the way I wanted them to be. When it came to coding the navbar, the main issue was how the navbar when pressed on a specfic section, showed both content when clicked to show a specific one. This issue was mostly because of the links to each section being too close to eachother. So to fix that I had to rejust the coding the navbar and postiton the links where thry weren't going to continue giving me the same issue over and over again. However, my hardest challenge throughout the whole process of desgining my website was coding my A-Frame design. A-Frame was hard because Coordinates and rotations had to be perfect or design wouldnâ€™t be clear or show, the Camera control, moving around sometimes was not active, and it would glitch. So, for the cordinates and rotations I had to make sure that the numbers all added up. I used google to help me. Then came the cameera control. Sometimes, the moving around would glitch or wouldn't be active. SO I fixed that by using the proper a-cameera and a-entity set up.</p>
            <p> REFLECTIONS: After seeing all the challenges I faced while making my website, It taught me that I should have prepared for it with more effort and motivation. I know that if I would have prepared for this in a different way, my project could have turned out way better than it did. When it comes to the tool I used (A-Frame), I should have spent better time exploring it because when it came time to use it in my project, it was a struglle that I was not ready for. So In conclusion, next time when working on a project similar to this, i have to plan and prepare better so that I could get amazing results.
